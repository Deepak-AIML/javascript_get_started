Interpreted vs Compiled language

Compiled languages:  first need to compile, then need to run. Usually don't compile if there is an error in the code. Example: C++,  Java, rust, golang
Interpreted languages: usualyy go line by line. Can run partially if the error comes later. Eg: js, python.

Javascript  -> Interpreted language

// ran code partially
console.log("hello world");
console.log(a); // returned error here

javascript advantage: Browser can understand html/css/js (standard was set in industry)
Thanks to node js, js can be used for backend development

javascript is loosely types.

let number = 5; // variable initially holds a number
number = "Hello"; // variable now holds string
console.log(number); // outputs hello

Multi threaded:

JS is single threaded.

synchornous vs async functions
sync -> together, one after the other, sequential.
async -> opposite of sync, multiple things are context switching.

Promises -> promises are syntatical sugar that makes code more readable.
